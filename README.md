The Awesome CG List! A collection of various resources to learn computer graphics, including books, tutorials, online courses, and more. Name a CG topic, chances are this list contains some stuff about it (if not, it is just a matter of time!).

### What is this "computer graphics" stuff?
Computer Graphics is a sub-field of computer science, that studies how to create images through computers, like games, movies and image editing.

### Books
* [Real-Time Rendering](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Rendering-Fourth-Tomas-Akenine-M%C3%B6ller/dp/1138627003/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1540516813&sr=1-1&dpID=51iw1UWKNhL&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch), by Tomas Akenine-Moller, one of the best on high performance graphical applications, very detailed explanations and contains many examples to illustrate its topics.

* [Physically Based Rendering](https://www.amazon.com/Physically-Based-Rendering-Theory-Implementation/dp/0128006455/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1540517251&sr=1-1&keywords=physically+based+rendering), by Matt Pharr, very code-focused book, goes back and forth between theory and its C++ implementations.

* [3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development](https://www.amazon.com/Math-Primer-Graphics-Game-Development/dp/1568817231/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1540517337&sr=1-1&keywords=3d+math+prime), by Fletcher Dunn, this book gives more focus to the math necessary for game development, this book does not cover topics like global illumination.

* [Ray Tracing from the Ground Up](http://www.raytracegroundup.com/), by Kevin Suffern, guides you through the task of implement a ray tracer, starting with a bare-bones project, and every chapter introduces a new conpect to add to the renderer.

* [Advanced Global Illumination](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Global-Illumination-Philip-Dutre/dp/1568813074/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1540517779&sr=1-1&keywords=advanced+global), by Philip Dutre, its focus are fundamentals to understand realistic image synthesis, such as light transport.

* [Realistic Image Synthesis Using Photon Mapping](https://www.amazon.com/Realistic-Synthesis-Mapping-Revised-Paperback/dp/B011DC2J3O/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1540518657&sr=1-1&keywords=photon+mapping), by Henrik Jensen, teaches math and algorithms to implement the photon mapping rendering process. It even has a complete C++ inplementation of the technique!
